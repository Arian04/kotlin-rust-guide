# Basics

To start with Rust you'll the compiler, go to [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) and follow the instructions.

Then I recommend installing and using Intellij CLion as you're already familiar with Intellij IDEs, otherwise you can use VSCode.

### Command line basics

Rust is controlled by it's package manager `cargo`

To run your program execute `cargo run`

To test it's `cargo test`
