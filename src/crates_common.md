# Common crates

These crates are the closest equivalent to the commonly used Kotlin libraries:
 
| Kotlin | Rust | Notes |
| - | - | - |
| GSON/Moshi | [serde](https://serde.rs/) | Much more powerful and flexible than GSON |
| JodaTime | [chrono](https://github.com/chronotope/chrono) | Essentially the same |
| JDBC | [diesel](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel) | Works with multiple databases |
